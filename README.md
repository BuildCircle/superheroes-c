# Build Circle Superheroes tech test

Superheroes and Supervillains are always battling it out, but how do we know who wins? This repo contains a function that gives us that answer. 

Some recent battles are stored in our log files - [https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/build-circle/characters.json](https://dc-battles.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dc_battles.csv)

## Task

Note: This tech test is deliberately loose. We're looking for your opinions and coding style.

Above all, Build Circle values clear, well-tested code.

1. With supporting tests, write a terminal app that downloads a log file of recent superhero battles and calculates the winner, the app should output the winner of each battle on the screen. The log file can be downloaded [here](https://dc-battles.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dc_battles.csv) You only need to consider the "happy" path.

2. Using any method you like, compile this to run on an ARM processor.
